INDRA GO networks for NDEx Integrated Query
===========================================

This repository implements a method for generating networks of interactions
between proteins that are annotated with a given GO term. These networks
are assembled by INDRA based on content from the INDRA DB, drawing on
multiple natural language processing systems and pathway databases.
The networks are uploaded to NDEx where they are exposed through the
NDEx Integrated Query service (http://search.ndexbio.org/) for enrichment
search.
